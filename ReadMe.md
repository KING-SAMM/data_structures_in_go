# Data Structures in Go

Welcome to the "Data Structures in Go" repository!

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to implementing various data structures in the Go programming language. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about data structures or an experienced developer brushing up on your skills, this repository has you covered.

## About

This repository contains Go implementations of essential data structures, including:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree)
- [Heap](/heaps/)
- Graph
- Hash Table
- and more...

Each data structure implementation comes with detailed explanations, along with examples and usage instructions, making it easy for you to understand and apply these concepts in your own projects.

## Why Go?

Go is a simple, efficient, and powerful programming language that is well-suited for building scalable and high-performance applications. By learning about data structures in Go, you'll not only enhance your understanding of data manipulation but also gain valuable experience in one of the most popular programming languages today.
